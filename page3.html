                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you like my translation, be sure you become a patron!<br><br><a href="http://patreon.com/shanefreak" class="text-primary">patreon.com/shanefreak</a><br><br>....<br><br>In Gotham City, on a cloudy but still warm morning, Schiller put down the coffee cup in his hand. He heard the sound of his colleague Anna's high heels. After a while, a sweet blond American came in with a dark face and said: "Those damned slackers at the reporting office have taken a day off. You can take the day off too!"<br><br>Schiller said, "Come on here, please have this cup of coffee."<br><br>"You never get me!" Anna roared, and Schiller happily took the coffee and walked out of the cafe. He glanced at the never-sunny Gotham City days as he began his fifth day here.<br><br>Schiller was a psychologist in his last life. In the wake of the plane crash, he was sent to this h****** city. Fortunately, he is neither a hero nor a villain, but a leisurely university professor.<br><br>Schiller was happy to be able to live for another day. The system in his mind sounded "ding ding" and displayed: "Peter Parker has sent a chat request."<br><br>As Schiller walked towards the report, he replied in his mind, "What's the matter? Peter?"<br><br>"Hey! I'll be starting an internship at Osborne tomorrow! I know how rare this opportunity is for me! And Gwen...I mean, she's coming too, we're together, it's awesome! We can be together talking about genome helices, those awesome big machinesâ€¦"<br><br>Schiller said silently in his heart, no girl would want to discuss this with you, little spider, stay awake.<br><br>Since he came here, Schiller obtained a "Comic Chat System". The first person he unlocked was Peter Parker, the young spider, who had been talking to him about how he liked Gwen for four and a half days. The mental journey of a teenager who wants to pursue a relationship, but is afraid to do so.<br><br>[ShaneFreak: I can't figure out, if it is Marvel or Comic Chat System, since he can go into other comic worlds, I will use Comic Chat System.]<br><br>While encouraging Peter, Schiller walked to the reporting office. He sat down and sorted out the forms, waiting for the new year's freshman to report.<br><br>However, it felt strange to say that Schiller had been here for so long and had yet to see the bat light.<br><br>Soon, students came to report one after another, holding a pile of materials, and all Schiller had to do was register their names and dormitories.<br><br>"Next!" Schiller shouted without raising his head. There was already a long line of people in front of him. A boy sat down and Schiller asked, "Name?"<br><br>"Bruce Wayne."<br><br>A moment later the tip of the pen stopped, and Schiller raised his head calmly and glanced at it. "Bruce... Room 306, Building 2, Boys' Apartment..." Schiller wrote on his own. The boy was blue-eyed and black-haired, very handsome. Schiller said: "Wayne ?"<br><br>"Indeed, I am Wayne."<br><br>Schiller repeated: "Room 306, Building 2, Boys' Apartment, can't you hear it? Get your watch and leave quickly, the people behind are waiting for you."<br><br>This time it was Bruce's turn to be stunned. He picked up the form and asked, "Which department are you a professor of?"<br><br>"Psychology, don't take my class, boy," Schiller said.<br><br>He aroused Bruce's interest, but Schiller just wanted to scold his mother. He just started college and he asked why there was no bat light!<br><br>Why did he become this guy's college teacher?<br><br>He swears that he doesn't want to be involved in the **** life in Gotham City at all. He just wishes he could eat and wait to die. I'm just an ordinary person!<br><br>Schiller shouted in his heart that he had a full understanding of the danger of the Batman series, and he didn't want to have anything to do with Bruce, especially the 18-year-old Bruce!<br><br>So Schiller was very indifferent and warned Bruce not to come to his class. He didn't want to hear the familiar voice of the clown appearing on college radio one day!<br><br>But it was this attitude that aroused Bruce's interest. It was Wayne! Gotham City's richest man! Why does this teacher seem indifferent to him, even disgusted?<br><br>But Bruce didn't say anything. He picked up the form, thanked him, and left. Schiller finished his freshman report and was about to go back to the professor's apartment to sleep. However, he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten his keys in the office. On the way, he met a tall and thin professor, to whom Schiller greeted, "Hey, Jonathan, are you here to get something too?"<br><br>"Yes, you forgot your keys in the office again?"<br><br>"Oh, that's right. I forgot when I left today because Anna urged me to leave quickly. I'll probably leave as soon as I find it."<br><br>When Schiller and Jonathan were in the office, an icy chill climbed up his back: Jonathan Klein!<br><br>Supercriminal scarecrow!<br><br>Jonathan, who had his back to Schiller, didn't see Schiller looking back at him. If he hadn't learned today that Batman had just gone to college, he wouldn't have remembered it. The memory of the scarecrow appeared in his mind - Gotham University Professor, Ph.D. in Philosophy and Chemistry, the scarecrow of the future who used fear gas to kill, Jonathan Klein!<br><br>Schiller took a deep breath and continued to walk upstairs with the same rhythm. Jonathan is not a scarecrow now, because Bruce is only 18 years old, he has not graduated from college, and he has not yet become Batman. Jonathan is not the most famous supercriminal in the world right now. As a high-level psychologist best known in the academic circle of "emotional psychology", Schiller is probably more famous than him right now!<br><br>Schiller is now a world-class professor of criminal psychology and abnormal psychology, a well-known psychological researcher, and Gotham's most famous psychology professor.<br><br>So Jonathan's attitude was quite pleasant just now... but what's the use of that?! Schiller can't develop poison gas! He's a purely liberal arts student, and Jonathan is a Ph.D. in chemistry!<br><br>Schiller's hands and feet were cold. He knew very well that Gotham City's big stage was about to open. Now he was just a helpless scholar, a weak chicken who struggled to move a chair. For an intellectual talent like him, let alone against these gangster gangs, he could be killed with a gun by them alone!<br><br>And his worries became reality. Early the next morning, Schiller, who came to the college's psychology clinic, as usual, heard a crisp knock on the door when brewing coffee.<br><br>"Professor Schiller, may I come in?"<br><br>Schiller took a deep breath. Are there still students in this broken psychology clinic? I'm here purely to stay idle, okay? Paid vacation, understand? Which **** is so ignorant...<br><br>Outside the door stood Bruce Wayne! Schiller almost spat out his coffee.<br><br>Schiller could only grit his teeth and say, "Please take a seat. So, do you have any psychological problems that you would like to consult?"<br><br>"Can't we come and talk if there is no problem?" Wayne spread his hands, and his **** style was evident.<br><br>Schiller pushed his glasses, resisting the urge to smack this bigot. In an attempt to avoid arousing the protagonist's interest, he said: "This is the place for psychological counseling for students. If you don't have any questions to ask, then you can leave."<br><br>Schiller swears that his words are so boring that they are more perfunctory than the plane broadcast, but Bruce still asked with keen interest: "Okay, then let me ask a question. What do you think is the meaning of life?"<br><br>Schiller took a deep breath. He felt that he couldn't go on like this. Whether he answered perfunctorily or seriously, this young Batman made it clear that he didn't want to leave. He had to find a way to dispel his interest.<br><br>God is pitiful, but he is not the protagonist. Without the halo of the immortal protagonist, interacting with Batman was a sure way to get killed.<br><br>He hurriedly opened the Comic Chat System in his mind. He remembered that he had a random chat opportunity with Peter Parker because he had guided Peter Parker's relationship issues in the past.<br><br>Looking in front of him Schiller swore in his mind:<br><br>"A young brat who swears to take revenge on all criminals who made him lose both parents and who still uses the appearance of a **** to disguise himself, now asks me what is the meaning of life? I want him to stop bothering me in the future, but how do I respond? I must answer the question carefully."<br><br>Schiller looked at the name in the dialog box. Okay, Charles Xavier! Professor X!<br><br>Schille paid attention to the avatar and found that Charles' avatar could be clicked. He clicked on Charles' avatar in his mind, and a dialog box popped up: "The first chat can randomly copy an ability (low-level). Do you want to copy? "<br><br>Schiller clicked "Yes" for no apparent reason.<br><br>"Telepathy (low-level) has been loaded."<br><br>Schiller felt a blur in front of his eyes. Suddenly, countless noises came and countless unfamiliar emotions rushed into his mind, making it impossible for him to distinguish. After a while, Schiller realized that he had indeed gained part of Professor X's abilities.<br><br>Telepathy is Charles' housekeeping skill, and with brainwave amplifiers, it can even brainwash the entire human race. However, Schiller's acquisition is extremely weakened. He can only vaguely sense the other party's emotions. It is impossible to read the mind directly and clearly.<br><br>Schiller focused on Bruce and noticed he was in a mess at the moment. No, it wasn't because he was so cynical.<br><br>Taking into account Batman's life experience, he should have just returned from studying in various countries. He must have entered university hiding his identity.<br><br>Bruce noticed that the professor opposite suddenly lapsed into a kind of quiet thinking. Schiller has a pair of slightly special gray eyes. The moment Bruce was stared at by these eyes, his keen intuition compelled him to contact the police - he felt spied on and watched.<br><br>Then, Schiller said: "Perhaps you have been waiting for someone to give you this answer. But promise me you won't bother me if I offer an answer then I am willing to give you this answer. "<br><br>"Oh? What is it?"<br><br>"Vengeance." Schiller stared right into Bruce's eyes and said. Bruce made a gloomy face, still, Schiller completed his sentence: "The meaning of life is revenge."<br><br>Despite Bruce's already gloomy expression, Schiller asked, "Are you satisfied?"? Mr. Wayne?"<br><br>[ShaneFreak : Schiller wants to hasten Batman's development as per comics he read, as he is just another normal guy right now.]</p>
