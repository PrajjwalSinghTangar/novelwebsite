                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you like my translation, be sure you become a patron!<br><br><a href="http://patreon.com/shanefreak" class="text-primary">PATRE0N.C0M/shanefreak</a><br><br>....<br><br>The Stark that Schiller saw was indeed on the verge of madness. His mental state was a mess. Through telepathy, Schiller was shaken by his chaotic and tangled thoughts through the wall.<br><br>Schiller took a deep breath and walked in. Stark looked at him and rolled his eyes.<br><br>Although Stark looked a bit haggard, he was not embarrassed. This was because the consequence of desperately trying to save his face was that Schiller could feel that he was on the verge of collapse. However, he was not willing to show it to Pepper.<br><br>Schiller coughed. Pepper looked at Stark worriedly, then turned and left. Schiller sat opposite Stark, and Schiller said, "Mr. Stark, can I ask you a question?"<br><br>"What do you want to ask?" Stark stopped a bit and continued, "And please don't talk to me about useless philosophical theories. My time is precious."<br><br>"Cough, no, I just wanted to ask what my hourly wage is?"<br><br>Stark was obviously stunned by this question, and he said in utter surprise, "What did you say?"<br><br>"I said I wanted to know the price of my counseling because I was drunk when Miss Pepper was talking to me about the price, and I woke up and forgot about it," Schiller said.<br><br>Stark was totally speechless at this point. He waved his hand and said, "Shouldn't you start by choosing an abstract topic that is commonly used by your psychiatrists... For example, the meaning of life, the object of sorrow, and the like..."<br><br>"Yes, that's the next step, after the consultation is officially started, but I have to make sure you can afford my counseling fee first."<br><br>Stark's eyes widened, and he said in shock: "What did you say?! Do you know who I am? Lord, what kind of primitive are you? Don't you know me? You don't realize that this is the Stark Building?"<br><br>"Yes, I know you are rich, Mr. Stark, but how much money you have and how much you are willing to spend are two different things."<br><br>"…How much do you want?"<br><br>"One million dollars an hour, no bargaining."<br><br>"For you! For you! You psycho-mad doctor, are you crazy? A million dollars! I can invite a dozen beauties to the yacht with that money..."<br><br>Schiller said, "A dozen beauties on a yacht won't make you any better, sir, especially when you feel like you're dying."<br><br>Stark's excessive body movements stopped. He stiffened for a moment and looked back at Schiller with suspicious eyes.<br><br>Schiller sat there calmly and said, "You are very afraid of death now, but perhaps the most fearful thing for you is not death, but the lack of a chance to redeem your mistakes..."<br><br>"Shit. Who are you? Who the **** are you?" Stark became emotional, and he said, "Did Pepper tell you something... No, she doesn't know, you..."<br><br>Stark stared straight at Schiller, and he said, "Don't play these ghost tricks with me. I don't believe there is any hellish mind-reading power in this world."<br><br>"There is no mind reading in the world, only psychology," Schiller said.<br><br>He stood up and said to Stark, "You can continue to be perfunctory. Anyway, my consultation fee is one million dollars an hour. Let's grind for a while, and I can buy a new car."<br><br>Stark was troubled by his serious talk for a while. He said, "Did you really find all of that with just your ridiculous psychology?"<br><br>"That's not relevant. What's relevant is the advice I can give you. It's better to solve the problem of death first. Of course, you may think that I'm saying it on a whim."<br><br>"But the way it is..."<br><br>Schiller stopped, and Stark stared at him. Schiller said, "Pay a 50% deposit first, and then we will start the next treatment."<br><br>Stark was steaming from his head now. He picked up the phone and called Pepper and said, "My sweetheart, where did you get a vampire doctor? ... Yes, he gave me a million-dollar one-hour consultation price..."<br><br>Immediately, Schiller picked up the phone and said, "Miss Pepper, Mr. Stark's calculation of a million dollars is a yacht's beauty..."<br><br>Stark immediately snatched the phone and said, "The money will arrive in your account in five minutes."<br><br>Stark still glared daggers at him.<br><br>Stark crossed his arms and said, "Go ahead, I really want to hear your next words."<br><br>"What have you been running away from?"<br><br>"What? What am I running away from?"<br><br>"You'd better ask yourself. I'm not referring to Miss Pepper's life-threatening phone call or an ambiguous text message from an ex-girlfriend. I'm serious..."<br><br>Schiller leaned on the table and hugged his arms. He pushed his glasses aside and said, "I have never seen such a rare case, very unique, very rare..."<br><br>Stark shuddered and said, "Hey, I don't like men. Stay away from me."<br><br>"You're not as absurd as you appear. I know someone very similar to you. He disguises himself as a playboy, likes to play fool, and never thinks about tomorrow."<br><br>"But he's smart, too smart, so he's been waiting for someone to give him an answer that comes from...his past."<br><br>Stark looked at Schiller, Schiller looked at him, and Stark whispered, "I'll give you two million dollars, get out of here. I'll tell Pepper that your treatment is very effective, I..."<br><br>"If I'm not mistaken, Miss Pepper is listening," said Schiller.<br><br>Stark was silent, and Schiller said, "For two million dollars, I'll tell you a method that really works."<br><br>"Make a deal."<br><br>"Your most taboo past has all the answers you want. I saw it in the news. The founder of Stark Group, your father..."<br><br>"Enough," Stark said.<br><br>He turned around, Schiller couldn't see his expression, Stark's voice trembled a bit, he said, "Pepper will transfer you the consultation fee, get out of here."<br><br>"...he will be willing to give you a second life. God bless you."<br><br>"Leave!!"<br><br>After Schiller left, Stark smashed the wine glass on the table, and in the S.H.I.E.L.D. office, Nick Fury pressed his earphones and said, "Go and investigate a psychiatrist named Schiller. I want all the information right away."<br><br>After Schiller left, the account quickly got a large sum of money. He thought happily, although Stark was difficult to deal with now, he was still willing to help this big dog solve his problems.<br><br>And then there was another surprise, that is, Schiller found that he could replicate the abilities of Spider-Man.<br><br>It turned out that the lack of this function before was not a system failure, but that Peter had not been bitten. Now that his spider abilities had appeared, Schiller could naturally copy them.<br><br>Schiller clicked to copy, and he got "Spider Sensing (Low Level). As opposed to the momentary effect of telepathy, this time there was a noticeable change. As for Schiller, his five senses have improved a bit, as he can see further, and hear better.<br><br>He had some regrets. It would be great if he could have the physical fitness of Little Spider, but it was a weakened version anyway. This is likely to improve his athletic ability a little, but he is still miles from being able to reach the skies.<br><br>Spider-Man didn't have that much power at the beginning. His spider abilities have gradually developed. He appears to be just a little bit better than ordinary people at the moment, and it is not too extreme.<br><br>But since the story of Spider-Man has begun, Peter's uncle may get into an accident. Schiller thought about it and sent a message to Peter. He asked: "How are you, Peter? Do you want to meet me at the hospital? I am a doctor here."<br><br>Peter's reply came quickly. "Wow! You're a doctor, cool. What hospital do you work at? What doctor? Or an orthopedic surgeon? But I don't think I will need a surgeon anytime soon. I'm very happy. I think Gwen will agree to my pursuit soon..."<br><br>Schiller said: "I advise you to come and check it out. Being bitten by an animal is not a joke. It just so happens that we can also meet..."<br><br>Peter was obviously hesitant. After all, it's not a wise idea to meet netizens at this time. He just got the spider ability, and he was so excited that he didn't want to do anything else at all. Schiller said: "I think you can bring Miss Gwen too. I am here at Presbyterian Hospital. I can give you a free full medical examination, and then you can go to the nearby coffee shop…"<br><br>Peter was a bit tempted. First, his family was not financially stable. He didn't have the opportunity to do a physical examination. There was no New Yorker who had never heard of the name Presbyterian Hospital. He said, "Thank you, but I want to take my uncle and aunt with me. They're getting older, of course, so that's probably a bit too much. If it doesn't work, pretend I didn't say it."<br><br>Schiller thought about it. Maybe it's better. He said, "Okay, I'll help you make an appointment for this weekend. You can also try calling Miss Gwen and her family. I have plenty of places to make an appointment."<br><br>Peter happily dialed to call Gwen. You know he has been helped by Gwen because his family conditions are not very favorable. Gwen often brings him snacks and yogurt. However, Peter always feels that he can't help Gwen. I've been busy, so I've always felt guilty.<br><br>But this is a worthwhile opportunity for compensation. Presbyterian hospitals are not so easy to get into. Even if Gwen's father is the commissioner of the New York Police Department, if he wants to make an appointment for a comprehensive medical examination, he will have to queue for a long time, or he will not be able to make an appointment at all.<br><br>Peter thinks that everything has been sailing smoothly recently. First of all, he has superpowers. A friend he met on the Internet is a doctor in a big hospital. He seems to be the attending doctor...</p>
