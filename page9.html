                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you like my translation, be sure you become a patron!<br><br><a href="http://patreon.com/shanefreak" class="text-primary">patreon.com/shanefreak</a><br><br>....<br><br>Schiller was on his way back to the apartment. He could clearly feel that someone was following him. The improved vision brought about by spider senses allowed him to see that someone was looking at him across the apartment building.<br><br>The apartment building opposite him was an all-glass structure, and there was a small pane in it that reflected light differently from other places.<br><br>It was not for nothing that he chose to open a clinic in Hell's Kitchen. After several days of observation, he basically figured out the work and rest rules of the residents in the apartment building.<br><br>Most of the people who lived here were office workers and elite white-collar workers. Most of them were single, with very regular working hours and a fixed circle of friends.<br><br>Living in such a crowd, it is too easy for special agents to find flaws.<br><br>Hell's Kitchen is different. Although it is the largest gathering place for gangsters in Manhattan, New York, and even the United States, it has a high population density, a large flow of people, and a large number of unfamiliar people. Moreover, gangs of all sizes are nestled and entrenched. It's the ideal place for an outsider like Schiller who wants to be a fish in troubled waters.<br><br>Schiller believed that if he stayed in that apartment for a few more days, at least four or five of his neighbors would become S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. These agents would seek information, either his own or Stark's. This is the way SHIELD operates. They don't care whether you need privacy or not.<br><br>But Hell's Kitchen is slightly different from Gotham. Although there are countless gangsters, big and small, Hell's Kitchen is less dangerous than Gotham.<br><br>There are poor people, gamblers, and addicts, but no scarecrows, no clowns, and no big villains.<br><br>The vast majority of people there are still ordinary people. Although guns and drugs are rampant, the victims are more ordinary people, not special people with special abilities.<br><br>Schiller intends to use it as his first stronghold in Marvel.<br><br>Stark's work efficiency is very high, and it didn't take long for him to convince congressmen to allocate a hospital quota to Hell's Kitchen.<br><br>Some MPs took this opportunity to trumpet their kindness. People claim New York will not give up any of its people, but they never expected this hospital to really open. You know, it's Hell's Kitchen, where even the devil loves to eat.<br><br>Opening a hospital?<br><br>Don't make any jokes. Unless the hospital can be built like a concentration camp, with tanks and cannons piled up at the entrance, and the doctors and nurses inside are all carrying machine guns, maybe there is still some hope, otherwise all the medicines there will be emptied overnight<br><br>But no matter how disbelieving the congressmen and how numb the people in Hell's Kitchen were a small psychological clinic was established in Hell's Kitchen.<br><br>The most well-known and largest slum in Manhattan was just eight blocks wide.<br><br>In fact, this place is much larger than eight blocks. There are dozens of streets, large and small, interconnected, and there are hundreds of gangsters crisscrossing here.<br><br>Some people say that the boss of Hell's Kitchen is King Pin, but that's not the case. In fact, King Pin's business scope extends far beyond Hell's Kitchen. It is a criminal industry chain that runs throughout the eastern United States and even the east coast.<br><br>His business spans the United States. Hell's Kitchen may be involved in some of his drug industry and product smuggling activities, but he doesn't actually live here. He also doesn't keep an eye on it all the time.<br><br>Daredevil, born in Hell's Kitchen, is his nemesis, and yet they rarely see the battlefield there. Little Spider, who has fought King Pin several times, is just an ignorant high school student at this time.<br><br>King Pin's ambition stretches far beyond unifying Hell's Kitchen, and he doesn't care about the chaos that broke out in Hell's Kitchen. Because there are all kinds of riots, robberies, kidnappings, brawls, and missing persons cases here every day, and some disturbances are nothing at all.<br><br>Therefore, when King Pin, who was far away in San Francisco, heard that some of his subordinates had lost their minds in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, he only thought that they were just taking too many drugs, and he didn't take it to heart at all.<br><br>Meanwhile, in Hell's Kitchen, a terrible tale slowly spread - there was a strange doctor living in a psychological clinic at the end of Mary Street, Ninth End Lane. The members of the gang who received his protection money or blackmailed him all ran out in horror after a while and then became crazy.<br><br>When this incident first started, several well-known gang bosses did not believe in evil, and once led their subordinates in. But it didn't take long for them to meet some monsters. Like being possessed by a ghost, Crazy began to struggle for air, screaming, running, and crying.<br><br>This incident caused quite a stir. Almost everyone on Mary Street heard about it, and rumors spread quickly.<br><br>One turned into ten, ten turned into a hundred, and everyone has heard that one must never go into Ninth End Alley. This is because there is a terrible curse there, which will make you see the most frightful things in your heart, and finally you will be frightened into madness.<br><br>Later, Schiller, who lived there, began to go out. Everyone heard that he was the owner of the clinic that lived on Ninth End Lane. People realized that it was not a ghost, but a weird psychiatrist.<br><br>According to the explanation, the group of gang bosses did too many terrible things, and he just gave them some friendly psychological counseling.<br><br>As for why they get crazy? Maybe it's evil.<br><br>The people of Hell's Kitchen might believe what he said about hell, but for those who live here, the wicked will never stop doing terrible things. It is their consensus.<br><br>No one born in Hell's Kitchen would feel guilty. It's normal to commit crimes here, and criminals are the majority of people here. Guilty? What conscience do you expect from someone who has been selling guns, drugs, fighting, threatening extortion, and gambling since he was a teenager? How can such a person be so guilty?<br><br>Everyone who heard about this thought that Schiller was a black magician, so he could put a curse on those people.<br><br>And Schiller, he wouldn't explain it. The fear gas brought from DC is really useful.<br><br>Although it is only the initial version, it is still very effective against ordinary people who have no abilities.<br><br>From the moment he discovered that he could travel between the two worlds by holding things in his hands and carrying things outside himself, he had the idea of ​​​​destroying the balance.<br><br>Although the power systems of Marvel and DC are different, there are many things that can be sold to each other. Of course, there are many things that can be exchanged with each other to deal with the enemies of both sides.<br><br>For example, if Schiller used fear gas in Gotham, once the news spread and Jonathan saw the symptoms of those patients, he would definitely think that it was his own fear gas.<br><br>But in Marvel? How could Jonathan know about Marvel? Naturally, Schiller would not have to pay any royalties.<br><br>Since the spread of such terrifying rumors, almost no gangsters have come to trouble Schiller anymore.<br><br>Of course, the consequence of mingling with this group of criminals is that a superhero comes to the door.<br><br>On a cool night in Manhattan, Schiller had just made a cup of hot coffee. He closed and locked the door of the clinic, ready to end the day's fishing work, get a night's sound sleep, and continue to harass Stark tomorrow.<br><br>When he put the coffee cup on the table, he heard a sharp noise from the door, then turned around, and in the dim light, he saw a tall man in red tights outside.<br><br>Schiller turned to pick up the coffee cup and said, "You seem to be a little late, Mr. Daredevil."<br><br>"Do you know me, doctor?" Daredevil asked.<br><br>"Of course, I know you, Daredevil. You're famous in Hell's Kitchen," Schiller said.<br><br>"But you seem to be here recently," Daredevil said.<br><br>"But I'm more familiar with your other identity, lawyer Matt."<br><br>Daredevil was obviously shocked. He didn't know how Schiller found out about his true identity.<br><br>And Schiller didn't wait for him to ask: "You have achieved impressive results at Columbia University, and your career path after graduation has proceeded very smoothly. Not only have you become a competent lawyer, but it seems that you also run a law firm of your own. Can you tell me, Matt, why you became Daredevil? Isn't the pride that a lawyer brings you enough to uphold justice?"<br><br>"Lawyer, help justice!" Daredevil snorted coldly, "Maybe you think so, I guess most people do. They think that lawyers should speak up and defend the disadvantaged, but in fact …"<br><br>"Actually? Do you think lawyers shouldn't do this?"<br><br>"Of course it should, I mean..."<br><br>"You don't think you can do it as a lawyer? So you want to do it another way, but what you can't do as a lawyer, can you do it with a ridiculously tight fit and a face mask? Yet?"<br><br>Daredevil said angrily, "My decision has nothing to do with you!"<br><br>"You know what? Your tone just now sounded very much like a rebellious little boy." Schiller said.<br><br>Then Daredevil realized that he had fallen into Schiller's verbal trap. The conversation had led him by the nose, revealing his true identity and touching a sensitive spot in his heart. He calmed down and said, "I have to admit, you're a talented psychiatrist, and you know how to use tricks when you talk. But I still have to ask, who are you? Coming to Hell's Kitchen for what purpose? Why are those people crazy?"<br><br>"You have so many questions, I can only answer one tonight. Obviously, I've been working all day and I'm tired. You can't interrupt my rest, after all, I'm not a gang member and I'm not breaking the law," Schiller said.<br><br>"But you're driving those gangsters crazy."<br><br>"You have no evidence."<br><br>"The police only need evidence."<br><br>"Do you think you are nobler than the police?"<br><br>"Stop talking in circles with me," Daredevil said.<br><br>"If you listen to me carefully, you will know where I come from and how I know your identity."<br><br>Daredevil felt a headache. He didn't like dealing with these cunning opponents, which made him have to maintain a high concentration at all times. And because of the shock in his heart just now, he no longer remembers the conversation he had with Schiller when he first arrived. If he wanted to recall it at this moment, his mind remained blank.<br><br>But if he couldn't answer, it would make him look stupid, so he kept silent.<br><br>"It seems that you have forgotten our conversation a minute ago. I really don't know. To be a superhero, you don't have a sharp memory." Schiller mocked.<br><br>Daredevil was secretly annoyed, and he vowed to remember every word Schiller said in the future.<br><br>"Two years ago, I was teaching at Columbia University. I saw the list of outstanding graduates, and you were on it, Matt. And when you were filling out where you wanted to graduate, you said you were planning to open a law firm, also in Kansas. Although I am a professor of psychology, I know your former teacher, and he talked to me in his conversation, and you have indeed achieved your dream."<br><br>"Don't change the subject. What I want to know is, how do you know Daredevil is Matt?"<br><br>"You may not remember, but when you first started down this road, you wore the black and yellow outfit your father wore to fight. I was invited to an underground boxing match after I came to Hell's Kitchen. By chance, the boss there seems to have never changed the style of the boxer's clothing in order to save costs."<br><br>"I understand that Daredevil may have been born here, and he must have something to do with the underground black market boxer. After investigation, the gang members you killed were all related to your father's death. It is not difficult to know your identity, naturally."<br><br>"Why are you investigating me? Are you guilty of being a thief?" Matt asked.<br><br>"It's nothing, it's just that if you want to rent a house, you have to know who the landlord here is and what he does. It's advisable to deal with him."<br><br>"I'm not the landlord here." Daredevil snorted coldly.<br><br>"Oh, yes? So it seems I've got the wrong person. I should reach out to King Pin. But I seem to have a feud with him, and I vaguely remember that one of the gang members who came to visit me mentioned him. The boss is King Pin."<br><br>"King Pin? Do you have news about King Pin?"<br><br>"Just a bit. When I paid the rent, I heard one of his men say that their boss is getting impatient with a kid named Daredevil. He's determined to find someone to kill you, so you'd better be careful lately."<br><br>In the end, Daredevil hurried back to his station.<br><br>It wasn't until after he got back to his room that he realized that none of his goals for tonight had been achieved.<br><br>He neither found out who Schiller was, nor warned him to be quiet, nor did he find out whether he had anything to do with those gangsters.<br><br>I don't know what method he used to drive those people crazy.<br><br>Matt patted his head. He suddenly felt that Schiller's analogy was right. It was as if he had rented the house to an unknown tenant. The tenant also paid the rent first, so in short, there is no way to compel him to move out, he could only let him swagger around in Hell's Kitchen.</p>
