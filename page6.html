                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you like my translation, be sure you become a patron!<br><br><a href="http://patreon.com/shanefreak" class="text-primary">patreon.com/shanefreak</a><br><br>....<br><br>When Schiller woke up, he didn't need to guess where he was. There was no doubt that he had returned to simple and unsophisticated Gotham City. This was because the strange kerosene-like smell in the air and the never-sunny day outside the window told him that he had come home.<br><br>He had spent a whole day on Marvel Earth, but the sun was just rising here.<br><br>Schiller sighed. For a while, he didn't know whether Gotham City was more dangerous, or New York City, the center of the universe, was more dangerous.<br><br>Though he said New York was more enjoyable, Gotham was home to him. At least the comic timeline has not started yet for the time being, for Schiller has no ability to clash with literal monsters like Thanos right now.<br><br>He turned over and got dressed. Gotham University requires professors to wear formal attire to class. Therefore, Schiller wore a shirt, vest, and suit every day, sometimes changing the style of the suit, or donning a trench coat.<br><br>The temperature in Gotham in September was not bad, maybe because it was a coastal city, but the city was still warm due to the blowing breeze.<br><br>As soon as Schiller left the house, he saw someone he didn't want to see - Bruce Wayne.<br><br>Schiller turned his head and walked back.<br><br>Bruce quickly caught up and shouted, "Professor! Professor! I have some psychological questions I want to ask you! Can you wait for me?"<br><br>Schiller scolded his ancestors inside his mind. There are many other teachers living in his neighborhood, and Schiller can't simply refuse when a student comes to ask a question. He can only say: "Okay, okay, I'm not deaf, Mr. Wayne, let's go to the counseling room. Speak."<br><br>The two entered the counseling room. Instead of sitting down, Bruce took the initiative to make coffee. He took the hot coffee and put it in front of Schiller.<br><br>He said: "Schiller Andel Rodriguez, a world-renowned criminal psychologist, holds four Ph.D. degrees in psychology, and participated in the famous Red Gloves massacre in Washington City. The investigation and detection of the case of the underground corpse in the seaside city, and, most importantly, four months ago, he resigned during the trial of the deputy mayor of the Metropolis, and accepted the invitation of Gotham University…"<br><br>"Professor Schiller, can you tell me why you came to Gotham?"<br><br>Schiller's hair stood on end. My dear, the original owner's resume can be directly sorted into Arkham Asylum! Only a lunatic would get into such terrifying cases!<br><br>And on top of that, you have participated in more than one scary case! Bruce kept a straight face and said everything on the document.<br><br>Schiller scolded his mother inwardly, but he still had no expression on the surface. He took a sip of coffee and said, "Gotham is a good place."<br><br>"Really? The city has the highest crime rate in America!"<br><br>"That's not the point."<br><br>"Oh?"<br><br>"The crime rate in the metropolis is not high, kid, sit down. You think the metropolis is safer than Gotham, right?"<br><br>"Isn't it?"<br><br>"Not for me," Schiller said.<br><br>Although Schiller inherited the knowledge and abilities of the original owner, he suspects that the original owner lost some significant memories before he crossed; at least not anything specific about those horrific cases. They seem a little vague to him now.<br><br>Schiller knew that the original owner must have been involved in an indescribably complicated case, and then had been plotted against.<br><br>Schiller said: "The security you see is only an appearance, Mr. Wayne. Behind this splendor of Metropolis, there is always darkness that you may not be able to imagine."<br><br>"Then why did you come to Gotham City?"<br><br>"...I think you've checked my resume, but it's still not detailed enough. I've offended too many people. Only here is safe."<br><br>"why?"<br><br>"Only criminals can deal with criminals," Schiller said.<br><br>Bruce Wayne seemed shocked by this sentence. He said: "Only criminals can deal with criminals, right? Professor, is that what you think?"<br><br>"Bruce, let's change the subject." Schiller said.<br><br>Bruce looked at him, his eyes gloomy like the sky of Gotham City. Schiller realized that he was no longer facing the cynical **** Bruce, but Batman, the most complicated superhero in history. Batman is an incomprehensible paranoid genius who borders on lunacy.<br><br>"If you want more from me, you have to pay the price," Schiller said.<br><br>"What do you want?" Bruce asked.<br><br>"You can't give me what I want now. You should understand what I mean." Schiller said.<br><br>"Then I can give it later, right?"<br><br>"It must be possible."<br><br>Bruce did not show his expression, and no one could see what he was thinking. He said, "Professor Schiller, unfortunately, there are some gadgets I added to your coffee, a nano-virus..."<br><br>"Being dishonest won't get you more from me, kid," Schiller said candidly.<br><br>"Looks like I'm doomed to come back tomorrow," Bruce said.<br><br>"Not necessarily," Schiller said.<br><br>"I hope you can give me a good enough grade on the final test, Bruce, prove that you have the heart to learn this skill, and then come back to me," Schiller said.<br><br>"I won't waste any more time here," Bruce said.<br><br>"You're far from being a teacher, Bruce. You're still a student," Schiller said.<br><br>"I have learned knowledge and skills from all over the world, hundreds of fighting skills, detective techniques, lockpicking, anti-reconnaissance..."<br><br>"But you haven't learned anything about Gotham," Schiller said.<br><br>Bruce fell silent. Schiller has already recognized that Bruce is not yet the dark hero Batman. Indeed, the idea of ​​revenge and the execution of justice has always been in his heart, and there may be a darker side, but he has not yet understood Gotham. What is this human hell? If this place is so terrible, why don't people just leave?<br><br>Bruce wants to use all of his resources, including Professor Schiller.<br><br>Batman is a hero with almost no weaknesses. He is wise, cautious, meticulous like a demon, and comparable to gods in a mortal body. However, the premise is that he must first put on that bat suit and become a dark knight who spreads fear in the night. What if Gotham with all its evil were yours, and what if you made the decision to face and fight all the filthy humanity? Bruce is not yet Batman.<br><br>Schiller suddenly felt fortunate. Maybe none of his methods would work against the dark knight lurking in the shadows of Gotham. This is because Batman is not Superman, he is not a hero, he is a thoroughgoing outlaw.<br><br>After Bruce left, Schiller stood by the window for a long time. Maybe Batman will come soon, and Bruce can't wait any longer.<br><br>The next day, Schiller reported to class as usual, and it was the first class for freshmen. Unfortunately, his attempts to prevent Bruce from choosing psychology were unsuccessful. This young Batman had to appear in Schiller's peaceful life to remind him that he was about to become a mess here.<br><br>But the strange thing is that Schiller found that Bruce was limping. His right foot seemed to be injured, but he insisted on coming to class. Schiller was thinking while lecturing, where did Bruce end up?<br><br>He sits on a fortune of billions, and Gotham City is the old Wayne family's backyard. Is it possible that he can still be beaten by thugs?<br><br>After class, Schiller rejected Bruce's obvious "let's talk" suggestion. He quickly put away the books and courseware, and then left with the crowd of students. He had to go out at night.<br><br>If Gotham City is hell, then Gotham City at night should make even Satam feel afraid. This city never stopped because of crime. After leaving the safe university, Schiller walked into Gotham City.<br><br>He's stalking Jonathan, the Scarecrow.<br><br>Jonathan is not a normal person. He has been committing murder since he was eighteen, so even if he is not a scarecrow now, he has already started his fear gas experiment.<br><br>Schiller didn't come to do justice; instead, he wanted to get some fear gas to protect himself.<br><br>Only a chemist makes the laboratory the safest place for thieves in this dangerous city. Jonathan and Schiller are both civilians, not gangsters, and they cannot use weapons. Only with the mind.<br><br>This night, it was raining again in Gotham. The night was as dark as thick ink, and the rain had a strong smell like kerosene. No matter how warm it was here, the cold September rain was still freezing, and Schiller was wearing a long trench coat. Holding a black umbrella and walking through a narrow street, he gradually reached the location where Jonathan hid the poisonous gas. This was an abandoned church underground in a block. As long as Jonathan was away, Schiller could logically go in and get it. Poison gas of fear.<br><br>Suddenly, Schiller's heart began to beat fast, and a picture of him being hit by an unknown hidden weapon flashed in front of his eyes. He turned around instantly and opened the umbrella with a "bang".<br><br>The two hidden weapons failed to penetrate his umbrella and fell to the ground. Spider sense saved Schiller's life.<br><br>Schiller put down the umbrella slowly. His face was not a bit as gentle as it was a moment before. He almost died!<br><br>Anyone who has just been attacked by death is unlikely to have a pleasant face. In a bat suit, Bruce watches his precision-guided and extremely fast darts blocked by the mysterious man's umbrella at the end of the alley. It's as fast as predicted in advance.<br><br>And the black umbrella with rain water poured down, revealing a face that Bruce is very familiar with, that of his university professor, Schiller.<br><br>It's really him, but it doesn't seem to be. Schiller's temperament was completely different. At this time, Schiller was more like the man Bruce saw on his resume, a lunatic who is addicted to criminal psychology.<br><br>Schiller took a deep breath and said, "You should know what would have happened if I hadn't blocked it."<br><br>"The dart will stop when it is thirty centimeters away from you," Batman said.<br><br>Bruce's voice was also completely different from daytime, and Schiller knew he had used a voice changer.<br><br>At this time, Batman is still far from good. His bat suit is not mature enough, he has no cape and belt, and his bat darts don't seem to be very easy to use. It can be seen that the fledgling Batman should have taken some detours. This novice was immediately challenged by Gotham's hell-level difficulty.<br><br>Schiller said: "I want to remind you, Mr. Bat, this area is different from the wealthy area you live in. There is no protective fence on the roof of the Mawson block. If you accidentally fall again, you may damage your internal organs or you might even rupture them."<br><br>The shadow on the opposite side was silent, and he asked, "How did you see it?"<br><br>"You're still too tender, Mr. Bat, the medicine you use has a unique stench, it's a high-end chemical, not something the poor ghouls can afford, and..." Schiller's eyes fell on Bruce's only exposed chin and he said, "No one here shaves so neatly and symmetrically."<br><br>"Who are you?" Batman asked.<br><br>Schiller opened the umbrella again, and he said, "Get home quickly, young master. No one will answer every question you have. I'm not a novice tutor."<br><br>After speaking, he left in the rain. Batman stood in that alley for a long time. He limped out, turned onto another street, and saw a beggar shivering in the rain.<br><br>He took out a stack of money and handed it to the beggar, and then he heard the sound of leather shoes stepping on the rain behind him, and a sentence that made his hair stand on end: "That's why I said you don't understand Gotham, Bruce."<br><br>Batman turned around and saw Schiller standing at the intersection. Schiller walked over and handed the umbrella to the beggar. The beggar took the umbrella and opened it to cover herself from the icy rain, then she trembled and returned the stack of dollars to Batman.<br><br>"Why?" Batman asked, taking the dollar.<br><br>"Because this is the Gutter Gang's territory, if they knew she had such a large sum of money, her body would be in the gutter the next day."<br><br>"A lot of dollars?" Batman's voice betrayed absurdity. "Thirty-seven dollars?"<br><br>"Yes." Schiller looked at the end of the street and said, "This is Gotham..."<br><br>"Welcome to Gotham."</p>
