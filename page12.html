                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you like my translation, be sure you become a patron!<br><br><a href="http://patreon.com/shanefreak" class="text-primary">patreon.com/shanefreak</a><br><br>....<br><br>Compared with Schiller, Jonathan looked more like a good person. He was thin, with slender limbs, curly hair, and a pair of large black-rimmed glasses. He always had dark circles under his eyes. Downright weak, like an otaku.<br><br>His character in college was also very similar to a trustworthy man. All Gotham students know that Jonathan's classes are not strict, and the exam is easy to pass. When several students are absent or late to class, he will only lift his glasses, and let them sit without criticizing them.<br><br>He looked ten percent like a nerd, while Schiller, the newly hired psychology professor, looked like the director of Arkham Asylum.<br><br>[ShaneFreak: XD, ah, come on!]<br><br>In addition to his straight back and black hair, he also had gray eyes that gave the impression of a synthesis of different cultures. He always wore the same grey clothes except for his umbrella which was black.<br><br>And most of them are coats, scarves, and formal clothes worn at work. Because Schiller has never purchased clothes, he has merely worn the original owner's clothes. Gotham is always raining these days, so Schiller almost always carries a black umbrella.<br><br>The students felt sorry for the audience, which was expecting him to be declared the series' final villain.<br><br>And Schiller had only been here for a few days, and his students discovered that he was actually a very strict professor. His teaching level is indeed very high, but he is ruthless with students who arrive late or leave early. Moreover, there is a test every few classes. He told everyone in class that at least 30% of the students in this class would fail, which made everyone nervous.<br><br>Although the students of Gotham University are from well-off families, they are not without rebelliousness. No college student will like such a professor. In the beginning, Schiller's class was thorny. However, soon, not knowing which mouth was broken, Schiller's resume spread, and the students in Schiller's class immediately became quiet like docile sheep.<br><br>After all, no matter how you look at it, it is impossible for a normal person to be involved in so many serial murders. Schiller soon became a campus legend at Gotham University.<br><br>Some people say that their professor is actually the murderer of these serial murders, and some people say that he actually has some kind of unfortunate curse on him. Wherever he looks, there will be terrible cases. People's imagination was really rich giving Schiller a tragic background and suggesting that his involvement in the investigation of so many homicides was in fact out of revenge.<br><br>Among the various versions of the story, there is always one that matches the students' inner expectations. As a result, the bizarre and somewhat terrifying tale spread very rapidly. Within a few days, most of the students knew about Schiller's past.<br><br>Schiller headed out for breakfast. The window he was standing at was never crowded. The students all looked at him from a distance. In class, the homework he gave was always complete. No professor could ever replicate such a feat.<br><br>Since the confrontation that night, Schiller could often feel Bruce following him, even during the day, on campus. Fortunately, he has spider-sense. Bruce tried mounting the camera several times, in his apartment, counseling room, and classroom podium but it did not work.<br><br>But that provided Schiller with inspiration.<br><br>It seems that the young Bruce hadn't thought about it, but he found that Bruce and Gordon seemed to have reached some agreement. Schiller returned to the Mawson block a few times at night, and he found that the two of them appeared to have really joined forces.<br><br>Finally, one day, when it was close to bedtime, the sky in Gotham was as dark as ink.<br><br>Schiller didn't plan to leave the house tonight. He wanted a good night's sleep. He found that the teaching profession at university was not as easy as he imagined. The psychological diagnosis and treatment room was occasionally visited by students who really needed psychological counseling. Whether it was to relieve anxiety, relieve depression, or provide psychological advice, these tasks were also very tiring, so he intended to have a decent night's sleep.<br><br>But it didn't work out. Jonathan, who was only active in the second half of the night, suddenly left the campus in the first half of the night. Schiller knew that he might want to catch a new batch of experimental products.<br><br>Gordon and Bruce have been spending a lot of time in the Mawson neighborhood lately. Jonathan is very clear that he can't beat the police. Once caught, he will definitely be locked up.<br><br>The man may not have the same level of physical fitness as Schiller, and even fear gas may be sprayed unevenly. Batman gradually gained some fame after sweeping away the Gutter Gang and several other small gangsters in the Mawson neighborhood. Everyone knows this place. There's an eccentric vigilante battling the gangsters, and Jonathan has been afraid to show up for several nights.<br><br>But his fear gas was about to make a breakthrough, and no experimental madman could accept it. Having failed his experiment, his experimental subjects have long been used up, and he must look for new ones.<br><br>Despite his inability to lift heavy objects, he is still able to capture the experimental subject. He only needs to find a house with an open window, put a pipe in it, and spray a large amount of anesthetic into it. Then, open the door of the house and drag the person out.<br><br>Schiller watched him leave the campus, and he had to put on his coat again, take an umbrella, and follow behind him. Although he didn't have a superhero mentality and didn't intend to be a superhero savior, it happened in front of him. Despite the tragedy, he will still take care of it.<br><br>More importantly, if Jonathan continues to mess around like this, there will only be a few people left in the Mawson neighborhood. Batman's debut journey will be cut short before he makes his debut. Anyway, the Scarecrow will be caught by Batman sooner or later. I'd rather choose a day than wait for tomorrow.<br><br>And Schiller used a small trick. He intends to teach Batman a lesson, so let him get rid of his arrogance.<br><br>The current Batman still has room for mistakes. This is because the Joker is just a circus actor right now. Schiller can't imagine how badly Batman would be played by him if the Joker appeared in front of the young Batman now.<br><br>Although Batman is still young, he still has many shortcomings. However, he has to admit that he has traveled all over the world, and the skills he has learned are not for nothing.<br><br>And Jonathan is not a meticulous criminal now. He has no special training, and he has no anti-investigation awareness. Many of his clues have been discovered by Batman and Gordon.<br><br>Together, they touched the chapel's underground. There, they found Jonathan's laboratory. It was not a very clever laboratory, and it could even be said to be very similar to a black-hearted workshop.<br><br>Dark, cramped, and smelly, Batman looked at the drain in the basement and said, "I'm afraid I know where those people ended up."<br><br>Gordon came over with a pistol and said, "Although I don't really want to ask, the truth must be written on my combat report."<br><br>"Aqua regia. Not only can it melt metals, but it can also melt the hardest parts of the human body."<br><br>"Okay, I know, you don't need to say it, I don't want to hear the details," Gordon said.<br><br>As they investigated in this small lab, Gordon found a small trace beneath an old crate, which consisted of some broken leaves.<br><br>"Red pine," said Batman. "I saw it in Cotyledons."<br><br>"Damn it, where are there any pine trees in Gotham? Otherwise, the weather here wouldn't be like this," Gordon said.<br><br>"I seem to have seen this plant somewhere..." Batman said.<br><br>"Gotham University, which is the greenest place in Gotham City, where the widest pedestrian walkway is flanked by this plant on both sides."<br><br>Gordon crouched down, looked at the trace carefully, and said:<br><br>The murderer's boots are likely to have stepped on fallen leaves, and there is still mud on them. Obviously, the heavy rain these days has caused him a lot of trouble. After he came here, the stains fell off on their own. The culprit didn't even clean up."<br><br>Gordon looked up and said, "Is the murderer a student at Gotham University?"<br><br>"Maybe it could be a teacher," Batman said.<br><br>"Is that the person you threatened that day?" Gordon asked.<br><br>"I did not threaten him," Batman said.<br><br>"But you cut his neck with a dart and caused him to bleed a lot. For a wound as long as that, I'm afraid it will definitely leave a scar," Gordon said.<br><br>"Are you sympathizing with a criminal?" Batman asked.<br><br>"He's not a criminal, at least not until he's tried."<br><br>"Judgment..." Batman snorted coldly.<br><br>Gordon noticed Batman's distrust of the judicial system. He did not refute him righteously. He has been a police officer in Gotham for a day or two. The judicial system here is indeed untrustworthy of trust. In fact, the entire system of order is untrustworthy.<br><br>"But in my opinion, you are holding a dangerous weapon and wantonly hurting an unarmed ordinary person, which is a threat," Gordon said.<br><br>"Unarmed..." Batman said.<br><br>He suddenly realized that he could not refute Gordon. This is because according to his knowledge, Schiller did not seem to have received any professional fighting training. Batman was sure that he could knock him down with one punch.<br><br>But he has been troubled by this person for many days, but there is nothing he can do. He suddenly remembered a sentence he had heard on the way to study - words are stronger than fists.<br><br>But that's about it, Batman thought.<br><br>The murderer is someone from Gotham University. There is almost no second answer. Isn't this evidence enough? Maybe it's time to send that crazy professor to jail.<br><br>He looked at the stained drainage pipes on the soles of his feet. In these pipes, the souls of more than 40 people had disappeared, and some of them must also have parents.<br><br>On that night long ago, his parents' lives disappeared in the alley, but no one paid the price they should.<br><br>But now it's different. With him around, these criminals will eventually end up where they should be, and none of them can escape.</p>
