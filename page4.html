                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you like my translation, be sure you become a patron!<br><br><a href="http://patreon.com/shanefreak" class="text-primary">PATRE0N.C0M/shanefreak</a><br><br>....<br><br>If Schiller had to describe Batman psychologically, his greatest trait would not be prudence, wisdom, or strategizing, but paranoia.<br><br>Batman never completely trusts anyone. Skepticism and conspiracy theories have been etched into his bones, and he is as skeptical as he is smart.<br><br>Schiller's answer obviously casts him under young Batman suspicion.<br><br>He felt that even the old housekeeper, who had been raising him since he was a child, only understood a part of him, not all of him.<br><br>But this gentle-looking psychology professor who seemed to be a completely ordinary person, gave him the most impossible answer, but also the most accurate and sharp answer.<br><br>Until Bruce got this answer, his inner fire told him that he was indeed waiting for someone to give him this answer. It was time to start his revenge now.<br><br>Yet compared to the answer he received, it was like someone had poured cold water over his burning heart. Bruce didn't believe, never believed that someone could see what was hidden in his heart.<br><br>But Schiller continued, "It's consultation time. I'm going to class. Goodbye, Mr. Wayne."<br><br>Schiller believes that Bruce must have been struggling for a long time.<br><br>If you have figured it out, dress up as Batman as soon as possible. Don't take classes here. Why bother with this group of delicate faculty? We cannot handle your group of villains!<br><br>Schiller thought that he had probably figured it out. Those gangsters and criminal organizations will be enough of a headache for him. Schiller can stay in college and eat happily on his pay, or fly to Hawaii for vacation.<br><br>Schiller's reputation in college is not bad, and his stellar reputation came from the original owner. As soon as the bell rings, he disappears instantly. Answering questions after class? Nonexistent.<br><br>He has been like this for the past five days. Fortunately, the original Schiller seems to be quite autistic and has no friends. He was hired as a professor at Gotham University in the past few months. So Schiller did not reveal any flaws since he was not well acquainted with anyone.<br><br>In the afternoon, Peter sent a message that said: "Mr. Schiller, everything is so terrible." with a frustrated chat expression.<br><br>He was aware that this chat system was not a brain-to-brain connection. Peter would message him through a social media application, and Charles visited educational forums, which contrasted with how he used the system.<br><br>The system translates these characters' chats into a form that they can accept. For example, Peter uses social software, and Charles uses a knowledge forum. If it is replaced by Thanos, it may be some kind of cosmic network signal or the like.<br><br>The other party will not feel awkward, and the system only guarantees they will answer Schiller's first question. If they wish to chat afterward, Schiller must come. Therefore, Schiller's main chat object is now the young, inexperienced spider.<br><br>Schiller replied, "What's wrong? Peter? Not getting along well with Gwen?"<br><br>"Oh, it's really not progressing well, but that's not what it means to be terrible."<br><br>"What's that? Did you screw up your experiment?"<br><br>"That's right. I knocked over a dangerous-looking experimental device, and one of the dangerous creatures inside ran out, and I was bitten by it."<br><br>Schiller knew that Spider-Man's fate had been partially changed because of his conversation with him. After speaking with him, he discovered that the other side was Spider-Man from the main universe of 616 comics. Peter, a high school student, should have been a bit surprised when he got to the exhibition. However, because he had fallen in love with Gwen, he told Schiller how charming and lovely his classmate Gwen was. Schiller was very annoyed by this small talk, so he gave him an idea and taught him how to chase Gwen.<br><br>Gwen came from a well-to-do family and found an internship with the Osborne Group during summer vacation. Peter didn't care about it, but Schiller suggested that he be cheeky and apply for the same internship. The application was submitted, but it turned out that Peter had been bitten directly by a spider from an experimental instrument from the Osborne Group. This was not a spider from the exhibition...<br><br>Anyway, he had to be bitten. Schiller comforted the poor, helpless spider and fell back to sleep.<br><br>Gotham's night was dark, conducive to sleep but Bruce stayed up all night, looking at the moon that had almost lost its shape in the thick fog. He held a stack of files in his hand, the first page of which was named Schiller Andel Rodriguez.<br><br>Schiller didn't know Batman was checking on him. In a deep dream, he heard an alarm from the system, but he slept too deeply, and in ignorance, a blue light swept acrossâ€”<br><br>The system's alarm sounds became more frequent, and Schiller still did not wake up. It seemed that something was blocking the system. Finally, after a chaotic sound, Schiller's figure disappeared directly.<br><br>"The emergency protection system is activated, the universe is located...the universe is located...the receiving universe has been determined, the identity information is being written...writing...writing failed...writing...writing successfully."<br><br>When he woke up again, Schiller rubbed his eyes and was dazzled by the sunlight. Hell, it's actually sunny in Gotham City!<br><br>As soon as the curtains were drawn, it was sunny outside... New York City.<br><br>It's completely different from Gotham's rotten weather. New York was very sunny in the morning. Schiller looked through the window and found that he should be in a high-end apartment in the center of New York City. When he turned around, he saw a mess of things on his table, as well as a wine bottle, with a work card under the wine bottle.<br><br>"Schiller, New York-Presbyterian Hospital psychiatrist...or the attending physician? I've crossed again?"<br><br>Hell, Schiller thought, before he could scold his mother, his cell phone rang. He picked it up, and said loudly, "Doctor Schiller! Where have you been? You must not be absent from the joint consultation today! Are you again drunk? Please come over immediately!"<br><br>The shock made his ears hurt, but when he considers that he is now a doctor, he might be able to save patients in such a situation.<br><br>Schiller immediately took his ID and headed downstairs to look for a car. There was no reason to live in such a high-end apartment without a car. He found a newly purchased Mercedes-Benz in the garage downstairs. It was the same model as his car keys.<br><br>Due to Schiller's previous visits to New York for academic exchanges, and the navigation in the car, he arrived at the Presbyterian Hospital, the largest hospital in New York, at the fastest speed possible.<br><br>As soon as he entered, the girl at the front desk ran up and said, "Dr. Schiller, hurry up, the joint consultation has already begun."<br><br>Schiller didn't know who she was. He just nodded indifferently and walked up.<br><br>Fortunately, someone led the way, and Schiller walked all the way to the conference room. When people saw him, the conference room became quiet for a while, and then the discussion continued. Schiller sat in the seat reserved for him, watching.<br><br>It seems that he should be a well-known doctor, and he is the first few in the undergraduate room. The person sitting opposite is obviously not a psychiatrist. One of the doctors looked arrogant and said: "Indeed, a group of experts who pretend to be ghosts. It makes sense, lest he pretends to be crazy again and tries to manipulate the nurses on the operating table."<br><br>[ShaneFreak: Doesn't make sense to me...]<br><br>Schiller takes a look at the famous character, Stephen Strange, Doctor Strange.<br><br>Schiller didn't bother him. Strange's appearance indicates that the car accident has not yet occurred. Now, this would be an extremely egoistic nuisance.<br><br>Schiller looked at the medical records without saying a word, but Strange didn't like him. He saw that he had drunk the day before and was late for the consultation the next day. Strange is a bit of a clean freak so he didn't like Schiller's disrespectful attitude. Besides, he always thought that all psychiatrists act like ghosts. In short, he hates Schiller.<br><br>During the meeting, he kept picking on Schiller, but Schiller followed the script and ignored him. After the meeting, Strange bumped him on purpose.<br><br>Schiller was very irritated by him, but after thinking about it, he would learn a lesson in the end. The accident is expected to happen in a few years<br><br>Just after the consultation, Schiller turned on the phone and received a call. There was a pleasant female voice, but she was a bit anxious. She asked, "Doctor Schiller, are you finished with your consultation? Please come down the stairs, Miss Pepper has come."<br><br>Tony Stark?<br><br>When is this supposed to happen? Has Iron Man been kidnapped? Or is it already back?<br><br>Schiller didn't even have time to check the information on the Internet. Since Stark's car had been dispatched downstairs from the hospital, he could only get into it quickly. In the co-pilot's seat sat a pretty woman who looked a bit businesslike: "Since Tony came back, you know, when he was last diagnosed, he started throwing tantrums for no reason, doing all those crazy things, and I heard him cry last night..."<br><br>"Miss Pepper? Are you okay?" Schiller asked tentatively. Pepper covered his eyes and said, "Sorry, but please be careful with his treatment."<br><br>Now, he was guessing, it was Iron Man who had been kidnapped and returned. He also knew that Stark's company's weapons had been used in an unjust war, and Pepper, probably due to Stark's psychological struggles, was too worried and asked for help.</p>
