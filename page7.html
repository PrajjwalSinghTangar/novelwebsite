                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you like my translation, be sure you become a patron!<br><br><a href="http://patreon.com/shanefreak" class="text-primary">patreon.com/shanefreak</a><br>....<br><br>Schiller discovered that he could travel between the worlds of Marvel and DC in deep sleep. At present, he has not been able to replicate this ability.<br><br>But fortunately, when he traveled to Marvel, DC's timeline stopped moving. Still, his experience in the Marvel world is more like a dream.<br><br>And when he traveled back to Marvel again, he found that time in Marvel's world was more fluid. He stayed in DC for a day and a night, and even then a day and a night passed in Marvel.<br><br>This is a little troublesome, Schiller thought. He was afraid that he had missed a day of work yesterday.<br><br>It cannot go on like this. In Marvel New York City, Schiller could not report to work every three or five days if his body could not pass through. Not to mention the Presbyterian psychiatry department is very busy, requiring psychological consultations.<br><br>When Schiller was thinking about resigning, Charles messaged and asked, "Is the child you instructed okay now?"<br><br>"No, not only is he not right but he also fell from upstairs," Schiller replied.<br><br>Obviously, Bruce's road to Batman didn't start so smoothly. Charles was obviously shocked. He said, "The kid jumped off the building? Why? Did your psychological counseling work?"<br><br>"He had some accidents, but the injury was not serious. I am trying to solve this problem. I recently encountered two similar cases. They both have an uncontrollable obsession with the past, but one chose revenge. The other is still running away..."<br><br>In a sense, Iron Man and Batman are somewhat similar. They are both billionaires, they are both "playboys", and they both research and equip themselves to become superheroes. Both are right. There is an obsession with the past that can't be let go of.<br><br>And this obsession is the death of their parents.<br><br>Perhaps Iron Man is less obvious, but his feelings for his father are more complicated than Batman's.<br><br>"Are you a pediatrician? Responsible for the psychological counseling of children? Or which hospital do you work in?" Charles asked.<br><br>"No, I'm not a psychiatrist, I am a psychologist. These are the cases I study."<br><br>"I think you should give them more care in addition to research, whether they are your patients or not. I always believe that if a person has talent in a certain area, he should use this talent to make the world a better place. It is good…"<br><br>Schiller sighed and did not reply to Charles. The social problem of mutants is too heavy and difficult to solve. From a sociological point of view, this is an unsolvable dead end.<br><br>After thinking for a long time, Schiller decided to visit Stark.<br><br>He called Pepper and said, "Miss Pepper, I think yesterday's clinic had some results..."<br><br>"Mr. Schiller! I really don't know how to thank you...Tony finally came to the lab! Thank goodness...I used to think it was inappropriate for him to stay in the lab all the time, but now I am so happy…"<br><br>Pepper on the opposite side was clearly excited. This woman couldn't help feeling a bit bitter when she mentioned Tony. Schiller comforted her and said, "I think I should go again today to consolidate the results of yesterday's treatment in time."<br><br>In a few minutes, Stark Industries' special car arrived at Schiller's apartment. After Schiller got into the car, he found that it was still a driverless high-end car, and the control panel of the car made a sound: "Hello, Mr. Schiller. I'm Jarvis."<br><br>"Hello, Jarvis."<br><br>Jarvis didn't seem to have been responded to in this way, and then Schiller asked, "Do you understand the concept of 'I'?"<br><br>"If you're referring to the psychological concept of 'id,' then I think I know something," Jarvis said.<br><br>Now Jarvis doesn't seem to be that smart. After all, Tony hasn't completely recovered and hasn't upgraded the smart housekeeper yet. Schiller asked again, "Do you have a 'self'?"<br><br>"I think I have."<br><br>"Did Stark create this concept for you?"<br><br>"I think so, sir."<br><br>"Then he is your father and creator. He created your personality and feelings for you. He should hope you have the same ability to think alone as a human being, right?"<br><br>"Perhaps yes."<br><br>"Then if one day, Stark is dying, and one of your decisions can save your master, but he himself is strongly against it, what will you do?"<br><br>Jarvis was silent for a while, and said, "I am an intelligent life created by Mr. Stark, and everything is based on Mr. Stark's orders as the highest criterion."<br><br>"If you obeyed the order and didn't save him, and he died, would you regret it?"<br><br>Jarvis remained silent for a bit, saying, "I'm not sure, I can't assume that future."<br><br>"If he died, do you think he would regret creating you before he died?"<br><br>"If he died, do you think he would hate you?"<br><br>"If he resents you, will you blame yourself?"<br><br>"If you were given another chance to start over, would you make a different choice?"<br><br>"If you disobeyed Stark's orders and chose to save him, and he blamed you afterwards, would you feel resentful?"<br><br>"If you disobeyed Stark's orders to save him, and he wants to destroy you because you disobeyed the order, would you resent him?"<br><br>There was silence in the car, and after a while, there was a sound of sizzling electric currents and Stark's fatigued voice sounded: "...Hello?! Hey! Damn it! What's wrong with you, Jarvis?"<br><br>"What the fuck did you do to my smart housekeeper? Why did he crash? Hey???"<br><br>[ShaneFreak: Happy? This time I replaced **** with a real word.]<br><br>Schiller felt in a much better mood, and sure enough, seeing others uncomfortable sure feels better.<br><br>After a while, at the Stark Building, Schiller didn't go to Stark's office but was led directly to the laboratory. Stark looked like he hadn't slept for several nights.<br><br>"Oh! Isn't that Mr. Schiller, our genius psychologist?! I really should get a Pulitzer for that interview you had with Jarvis in the car! The questions you asked were hypothetical, whereas I needed data calculated intelligently. They just blew my smart housekeeper's mind!" Stark exclaimed.<br><br>Schiller spread his hands and said, "Don't thank me, I'll give you electronic counseling for free. There's no charge.".<br><br>Stark took a deep breath, stood up, and shouted, "Mark 2!"<br><br>A set of silver battle suits flew over in an instant. Mechanical jazz sounded and activation was completed almost instantly. Iron Man lurked in mid-air, showing off his silver Mark 2 armor. Obviously, he is not free these days.<br><br>"Mr. Stark, I am a psychiatrist, not a boxer. You don't have to wear such thick clothes to talk to me."<br><br>"Hey, don't you see what I'm wearing?"<br><br>"Yes, I see, I'm not blind."<br><br>"A set of cross-era battle armor. Can you give some reaction?! Do you know what this set of armor means?"<br><br>Schiller found a table and sat down on his own, opened his medical record book, and said, "I know, Mr. Stark, you have made remarkable progress in technology, which is gratifying. But I see this armor. The suspension function is familiar. It seems that the suspension car launched by Howard Motors has the same purpose..."<br><br>"Shut up! Don't mention that name!"<br><br>When Stark's helmet mask opened, Schiller asked, "Can we start today's treatment?"<br><br>"You know I don't need any shit psychotherapy. Also, because you broke my Jarvis, the loss is deducted from your consultation bill today, exactly two million dollars, and we'll talk about other things in the next two hours. "<br><br>"I didn't break Jarvis, I just told you in advance the danger of electronic life," Schiller said.<br><br>"Aren't you the kind of ultra-conservative? You think artificial intelligence will destroy the world?" Stark sat across from him and asked.<br><br>Schiller shook his head and said: "Although my psychological consultation for electronic life is free now, it is only free this time. If you still need me to conduct a psychological analysis of electronic life in the future, the consultation fee is two million dollars an hour."<br><br>"Keep harping on shit," Stark said.<br><br>"This is the American healthcare system," Schiller said.<br><br>Anyway, when Ultron comes out, Stark will certainly find him.<br><br>"Okay, let's talk about business. Where did you hear about my father..."<br><br>"Actually, I don't know, but all this can be deduced. First of all, the fact that you are dying is almost written on your face. It's almost impossible for me not to see it."<br><br>Iron Man touched his face, and the armor mask closed with a click.<br><br>"Miss Pepper didn't tell me much about the details of your kidnapping, but in short, you invented a very powerful thing and ran out."<br><br>"You can still walk, which means that you were not seriously injured physically. I am not interested in learning about your strange technologies, but I know that if you want to escape from the kidnappers single-handedly, you must use some special means."<br><br>"Combined with your rotten face like shit, I'm afraid it's this method that brought you into the situation you are in today."<br><br>"Anyway, if you don't stop, you will die."<br><br>"You already know who you can turn to for help, but you just don't want to face it. Combined with some news of the death of the founder of Stark Industries, I'm sure your childhood may have been psychologically traumatized."<br><br>"In this case, of course, I will give a suggestion that a doctor in my heart should give, which is to face the past, such as looking for your father's relics, trying to reconcile with childhood trauma, etc., this will at least help you think rationally... "<br><br>"What nonsense," Stark concluded.<br><br>In some ways, he is talking nonsense. Because he is a traveler, a walking spoiler, he knows almost the whole plot.<br><br>After several days of inquiries and observations, Schiller felt that this should be a mixture of the 616 comics main universe, TRN688 Sony universe, and MCU movie universe.<br><br>Because even if Peter's life trajectory was changed by Schiller, he was still bitten. This proves that there must be a Spiderman here, then there must be other parallel earths. So it is not a simple MCU universe.<br><br>Sony Universe is also very adept at implying mutants exist, but there are no mutants in the pure Marvel universe.<br><br>In short, Schiller himself regards this place as a brand new hybrid Marvel universe. However, no matter how it is mixed, the transformation of Iron Man is an extremely significant node in the entire universe. Its background story is roughly the same, anyway.</p>
