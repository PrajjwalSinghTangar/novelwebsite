                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">If you like my translation, be sure you become a patron!<br><br><a href="http://patreon.com/shanefreak" class="text-primary">patreon.com/shanefreak</a><br><br>....<br><br>Gordon unbuttoned the collar of his shirt and twisted his neck. Relaxing his shoulders, he turned to look out the window at Gotham's dark rainy night, which was cold and damp.<br><br>His colleagues greeted each other and left the station to return to work. One of them said to Gordon, "Hey man, you shouldn't have taken that tough case in the first place, dozens of missing people? It's midnight to check the files."<br><br>Gordon smiled helplessly, and said, "You yourself said there have been dozens of disappearances... I have to get snacks."<br><br>After all his colleagues left, Gordon made himself a cup of espresso, and he planned to fight all night tonight.<br><br>The disappearance cases in Mosenjie District are very strange. In the past, even if disappearances were done very covertly, the bodies of some dead victims would still be found. However, among the 46 people missing in Mosenjie District, not a single person was found. It's normal for a body to disappear from the streets of Gotham but 46?<br><br>Gotham has never been a city of laws. There are so many gangsters here. A seasoned gang member would never dispose of a dead body, preferring instead to throw it. Even they knew the police were nothing in Gotham.<br><br>Among the dozens of people who disappeared in the Mawson neighborhood, there are people of all occupations. They hardly have any common rules. The only thing they have in common is the resident population of the Mawson neighborhood.<br><br>At this time, Gordon is still very young. He is only the head of a small police station. He is still far away from the chief. This case, which no one wanted to take over, was a hot potato. Gordon took it over. Even though he knew that this would be a thankless job, he still planned to do his finest to plead for the victims.<br><br>Just when he stayed up late to sort out the files, and was already sleepy enough, he suddenly felt a noise behind him. When he turned around, a huge shadow enveloped him. Gordon immediately touched his waist, but his pistol was not there...<br><br>A man on the other side was wearing black tights and a black cape, with two pointed ears on his head stood, "Who are you? Why are you in the police station?"<br><br>"You can think of me as a vigilante. I'm investigating the disappearance of people in the Mawson neighborhood. I found out that you were there today and yesterday. You should be the police detective in charge of this case. I hope to be able to get information about these disappearances from the population profile."<br><br>Just as Gordon was about to reject the person opposite him, he heard him again: "Of course, I also have some clues here that I can exchange with you, or I can very well solve this case with you."<br><br>Vigilante? Gordon thought, this is ridiculous, there is no such person in Gotham City, otherwise, it would not be called Sin City.<br><br>The first encounter between Gordon and Batman was not pleasant. The two of them faced off at the police station for a long time. Obviously, the brand-new Batman had not yet grasped the essence of leaving without finishing the conversation. He and Gordon talked for a long time and finally got impatient.<br><br>Batman found himself really unlucky. There are countless derelict police officers in Gotham City, but he happens to meet the most serious one. Gordon even wants to swear to protect those files. Batman doesn't want to hurt him, so there was no other way.<br><br>After Batman cleaned up the gutter gang, he was left stunned by the beggar. Despite saving the beggar at the end, he reflected on his actions and realized he was not so helpful at first. I must start with simple objectives.<br><br>This is the starting point of his superhero journey. Except for the Gutter Gang, it is not peaceful here. The number of missing persons in the Mosen neighborhood has reached a very dangerous number, and the resident population here is only a few hundred. That's it, but more than 40 people are missing, and Batman is determined to use this case as the starting point for his debut.<br><br>And, of course, he has something to suspect.<br><br>A college teacher, who didn't sleep in the middle of the night, sneaked into the block where the Gotham gang was located. He appeared and disappeared for no reason. Is there anyone more suspicious than this?<br><br>It's not that Batman didn't think about it. He turned to Schiller to confront him, but he knew that it might be difficult for him to beat the professor in terms of words. After obtaining sufficient evidence, he will be brought to justice.<br><br>[ShaneFreak: XD, come on!]<br><br>On this day, Batman was in the Mawson neighborhood again. He couldn't get the missing person file from Gordon, so he infiltrated the missing person's home and wanted to find some other clues in his house...<br><br>As soon as he looked out the window, he saw Schiller's figure again. Not far downstairs, Schiller held a black umbrella under a street lamp and Batman glanced at him from the opposite wall.<br><br>He found that Schiller was looking at the place where the beggar used to be, but there were no beggars there anymore. Batman sent the beggar to the most prestigious hospital in Gotham City and covered all his treatment expenses. Both legs were amputated, but at least he survived.<br><br>Since the beggar has been leaning against the wall all year round, there has been a dark stain there. The rain formed a small puddle where he used to sit. Schiller stood on the opposite side of the road, looking at the puddle, but Batman didn't know what he was thinking.<br><br>In the end, the young Batman couldn't hold his curiosity. He jumped down and appeared in front of Schiller.<br><br>"Good evening, Batman. I remember you called yourself that last time, so I'll call you that."<br><br>Batman's eyes under the mask stared at him tightly, and he said, "Don't talk to me in circles. You know what I'm here for."<br><br>"You are here to be the savior, I know. For example, you saved a poor beggar."<br><br>"Did you do the disappearance case in the Mawson neighborhood?" Batman asked.<br><br>Schiller shook his head, and Batman said, "You're the only outsider, and you don't have any motive for being here."<br><br>Schiller said: "Obviously, you already have the answer in your heart, so why are you asking me? You are always very adept at turning what you have determined into questions and asking others."<br><br>"If you get an answer that you are satisfied with, you will naturally be satisfied, but if you don't get the answer you want, you will become very angry."<br><br>"If I say I'm not the murderer, you'll feel very angry, but your anger doesn't come from your sense of justice, it's just that I didn't give you the answer you wanted."<br><br>"You think you can predict things like god, don't you?" Schiller asked.<br><br>"I said, don't talk in circles with me, you are the only suspect here..."<br><br>Before Schiller could speak, he found a bat dart flying along the side of his neck. He seemed to underestimate the enemy. Whether it was Batman at this time or Batman in the future, although they didn't kill people, they did often beat up criminals. They didn't shy away from breaking their legs before sending them to the hospital.<br><br>But obviously, this young Batman is missing a program.<br><br>Schiller didn't speak for a while, and another bat dart rubbed his neck and flew over. This time, Schiller didn't tilt his head in advance using spider sense, but looked at Batman quietly.<br><br>The bat dart left a hole on the side of his neck, and blood flowed out. At this time, there were a series of rapid footsteps at the end of the alley, and a voice shouted: "Stop!"<br><br>Batman turned to look at the end of the alley. Under the street lights, Gordon was aiming at the two with a pistol.<br><br>"Hello, Detective Gordon," Schiller said.<br><br>Detective Gordon held his gun and walked slowly forward. He said, "Put down your weapons and don't move."<br><br>Schiller spread his hands, indicating that he had no weapons, and Batman put away the bat dart in his hand.<br><br>Gordon approached, only to find that Schiller's neck was bleeding, the blood flowing down his shoulders, and even staining his shirt.<br><br>Schiller said: "Batman, you made a mistake. You said I was the only suspect, but the detective obviously didn't think so."<br><br>"The people who have no motive to appear here, except me, and you."<br><br>"I'm here to investigate missing persons," Batman said.<br><br>"Then so am I," Schiller said. "But obviously, you're no more noble than me, because we're not cops, and I think only Detective Gordon has the authority to do that right now."<br><br>"I'll find evidence," Batman said.<br><br>"If you also need evidence, what's the difference between you and the police?" Schiller asked suddenly.<br><br>Batman had nothing to say for a while. He thought Schiller would ask him for evidence, and Batman knew that even though Schiller appeared where he shouldn't, it didn't work. As evidence to prove that he did commit a crime, he made up his mind to find clues to prove that Schiller was the murderer.<br><br>But Schiller's question got to the point, Batman thought. He always thought the police were very useless, because they had to provide evidence. This was even if the murder had happened in front of them. But they wouldn't let the murderer go without arresting the person most suspected of being involved in the crime.<br><br>It was like this when his parents died. No police officer gave a proper explanation, and no one was brought to justice. His parents died, but no one paid the price.<br><br>He thought, if he also needs evidence, then why doesn't he go to the Gotham Police Department and become a cop?<br><br>But if he does not need evidence and arbitrarily arrests anyone, then what is the difference between him and a criminal?<br><br>Batman regretted it, so he shouldn't have come forward to talk to Schiller. Whenever he talks to Schiller, he gets a bit shaken. This kind of psychological and conscious shake is the most terrifying for him.<br><br>Every time after meeting Schiller, Batman has to sit back and think deeply for at least two or three days. This is to understand the question he asked, to find his own answer, and to strengthen his confidence, so he can come out and play again.<br><br>He feels that it is no different from taking a class. When the teacher asks a question, the students think for themselves and write a paper. The next time they meet, in addition to checking the homework, there are new questions waiting for him, followed by another, as if never-ending.<br><br>And Schiller complained to himself that Jonathan was really capable. As a result of Schiller stealing the fear gas, not only did he not slow down his research speed, but he even became more insane. As a result, Jonathan started kidnapping the experimental subjects at night.<br><br>[ShaneFreak: Damn, he is the culprit?]</p>
